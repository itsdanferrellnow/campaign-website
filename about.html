    I’m Dan Ferrell, and I’m running for Asheville City Council to truly make Asheville a safe town for all of us. We live in a different world than we did a few years ago, and I want our town’s policies to reflect our community’s real needs.

  <p>
    We live in a time when our federal government is moving to force their brand of hate and cruelty on not only the most marginalized of our country, but on everyone else, too.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we learned during the Hurricane who we are: <b>we are people who take care of our neighbors because we know there is enough for everyone.</b> We don’t have to live in a world of scarcity; we just have to live in one where we get the right things to the people at the right time.
  </p>

  <p>
    When all of our usual systems were down, we worked together to build something deeply human. We fed each other, we clothed each other, we helped our neighbors find housing and community. We took care of each other, and in that we grew stronger.
  </p>

  <p>
    But we’re facing another crisis, a longer crisis. One that will require us to act now if we want to be prepared. I saw so many of you out in the streets in 2025 demanding that we fight back against the federal government. I want to be a voice for our community that is clear that we need to prepare for a future that looks radically different from our past. Preparing is our first step to resisting.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can prepare for long-term oppression by ICE, and we can prepare for the end of federal democracy - the advent of a so-called 'King'. We see the federal government trying to starve our neighbors by eliminating the SNAP benefits, but funding ballrooms. They disappear fathers, mothers, children, based on where they were born or simply on their perceived ethnicity. They criminalize LGBTQ+ people and take away their access to healthcare and identity. They imprison, attack, and kill Black and Brown people with increasingly unmasked hatred.
  </p>
  <p>
    The federal government is making communities everywhere unsafe for so many, but we can build a place of resilience against that right here, right now. We can protect ourselves and our neighbors because we all deserve the safety to live our lives free from the chaos of state-funded terror.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether our future holds attacks from our own government or new climate-related catastrophes, there are ways we can increase our resilience and security as a town for the benefit of everyone, not just for the wealthiest.  As a city counselor, I will act in a way that reflects the real danger that exists in front of us, emphasizing food and water security, as well as the housing needs of the majority.
  </p>
  <p>
    I plan to explore ways to deepen neighborhood organizing, because as we saw after the hurricane, there are times when our neighbors are all we have. And on the political level, when neighbors come together to identify their own greatest needs, we can deepen our democracy by listening to every neighborhood, not just the loudest or wealthiest ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    This town is not just for business owners, tourists, and the wealthiest of our neighbors. It is a home for every single one of us. And none of us can truly thrive while our neighbors struggle to meet their basic needs. As a city councilperson, I hope to move the needle to more deeply reflect that you matter here, too.

          <p class="mb-3">Hey neighbor!</p>
          <p>I'm honestly, just a parent of two young kids in Asheville schools, a former community organizer, software engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm just a neighbor of yours, and like you, tired of City Council's inaction in the face of fascism, recession, and climate catastrophes. I want someone to take it seriously, and fight it in every way we can in Asheville. It's not something that happens on the national level: we can fight right here and now.
          </p>
          <p>
            My politics and my values are so entwined. I believe in basic human dignity and rights, that every human deserves the basics: clean food and water, shelter, healthcare, education, and community. I believe in it because my hard working parents weren't able to provdie that always for me, during the 'good' times in the 90s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every 'radical' thing I believe as a Democratic Socialist, boils down to the simple belief that every person deserves to live a dignified life. That it's not too much to demand that we all deserve something better than what we've gotten, and we deserve it in community with each other, protecting each other and having each other's back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like many of us, what happened after Helene changed me, my belief about what we can do was transformed. Watching bartenders bring truckful after truckful of water to neighbors, food be shared by all, taking in neighbors that needed rest, helping rebuild the infrastructure of our community. These were radical things. We didn't hoard, we shared, we didn't reject, we embraced our neighbors. Didn't matter what side of the political line you were on, you helped each other out.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was truly the most beautiful site. My neighborhood in East Asheville had a bulletin board, we knocked on neighbors doors, we shared food, gas, water, generators. There was enough for everyone. Everyone had a part to play, and it wasn't equal, but it was <i>equitable</i>. When we had extra, we shared outside our neighborhood. These principles taught me everything I needed to know about the lie that we can't work together in times of crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>That crisis continues now. And we can do something about it, because we've navigated crisis before.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            City council needs change. It needs it now. When you vote for me, you'll have someone on your side who'll fight for what is right and good in this world. We may not agree on everything, but you'll know that my starting and ending point is always: how do we make sure our neighbors are safe, and taken care of. But it doesn't start or end with me, it starts and ends with all of us.
