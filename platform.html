          <p class="mb-3">I need to tell you a story.</p>
          <p>
            In the winter of 2004, I lived outside of Chicago. I was living paycheck to paycheck, getting paid slightly above minimum wage, just scraping by like so many families do right now. I lost my job because I got sick for an extended period of time. I lost my housing because I lost my job. And I ended up homeless.
          </p>
          <p>
            I slept wherever I could find for six months, walked three miles in below-freezing temperatures to work, and had a few friends who were able to support me in little ways. I eventually found enough good fortune to find a car to sleep in, allowing me to save a thousand dollars to rent an apartment (back when you could rent an apartment for $500/mo).
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t because I worked harder than any other person who has lost their home; it wasn’t because I did something that a lot of other families haven’t tried. It was simply because I just got lucky enough, long enough, to get back on my feet. Enough things went right for me for long enough that I was able to find some savings again.
          </p>
          <p>
            I understand how hard it is here for people to get by in Asheville. I’ve been in the same places that many working class families in Asheville have been. I’ve felt how everything just squeezes in on you from all sides, and one wrong step can mean the difference between staying in your home or living on the streets.
          </p>
          <p>
            What happens if the economy struggles under Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled federal government? What happens to the <a href="https://www.unitedwaync.org/alice-report-unveils-hidden-population-report-reveals-42-households-2023-struggle-afford-basic#:~:text=42%25%20of%20North%20Carolina%20citizens,or%20receiving%20necessary%20medical%20care.">54% of North Carolinians who are currently living paycheck to paycheck</a> if they lose their jobs because the economy crashes? How many of our neighbors will no longer have a safe place to exist?
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to plan for a future in the face of the problems of the present, and we can do that together.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Hurricane Helene, we worked together to mend and make whole what could be repaired. We found housing for our neighbors; we made space at our table to feed each other. In times of chaos and struggle, like now, what stops us from doing that again?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a really personal story to me, and why I believe in the project of making Asheville affordable. If we want to prepare for an uncertain future, we need to actually prepare. Please read the other points for more specific policies I'll work towards.

          <p class="mb-3">After the hurricane, the question before every one of us became: where were we going to get our next meal when we didn’t have power, water, or access to stores?</p>
          <p>
            But the truth is, every day we all navigate our need for food. For some, it’s easy. Maybe even joyful. But because of the deeply inequitable way wealth is distributed in our community, for others getting enough to eat is nearly impossible. And it simply shouldn’t be that way. Every single one of us deserves access to healthy, safe food.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a world where <a href="https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/10/what-makes-this-government-shutdown-different/#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20OPINION%20%E2%80%94,otherwise%20been%20detected%20and%20addressed.">food safety inspectors aren’t checking to see if our food is safe</a>, how do we know what we’re getting at the commercial grocery stores is safe anymore? When the federal government intentionally stops paying out SNAP benefits that go to 28,000 people in Buncombe County, it’s a crisis. It’s the same sort of crisis we experienced after Hurricane Helene, and we can respond to it as a city, as neighbors, together to help make sure kids and families don’t go hungry.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the hurricane, when our community’s food needs were the greatest, Ingles, our neighborhood Corporate Grocery Store, <a href="https://www.latintimes.com/north-carolina-cops-accused-barricading-grocery-store-after-hurricane-refusing-sell-baby-formula-560731">blockaded their stores with police</a>. And there’s two problems here that really should be talked about here: the first is that in a time where we could use everyone’s help for taking care of our community, especially our civil servants like the police, they were busy guarding Ingles' profits. And the second is that Ingles’ response to our food crisis didn’t reflect a true partnership with the food needs of our community.
          </p>
          <p>
            My values say that in times of crisis, we all help each other. In that moment, the City of Asheville, the Asheville Police, and Ingles did not do everything in their power to help.
          </p>
          <p>
            We must build a more resilient way to provide food to our community. We need food distribution centered on access, not on profits. And we need it to support the livelihoods of our area farmers.  I’m proposing building a public-good grocery center providing safe, clean food that’s accessible to everyone. It would host diapers and formula at cost, and safe, local produce, from local farmers paid fairly for their time and effort. This is something we could be proud to see our tax dollars support.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the hurricane, we all fed each other with the clarity that every one of us deserves to eat. We can intentionally rebuild this notion again. We can use our resources together to make it so that everyone, no matter your financial situation, can always get clean, safe groceries and feed their families. If we want to prepare for an uncertain future, we need to actually prepare. Please read the other points for more specific policies I'll work towards.
