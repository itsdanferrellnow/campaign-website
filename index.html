          This town is not just for business owners, tourists, and retirees. It is a home for every single one of us. And none of us can truly thrive while our neighbors struggle to meet their basic needs. As a city councilperson, I hope to make city council act in a way that truly reflects that you matter here, too.

            The cost of living keeps going up: families are being priced out of living here, and housing insecurity grows every year. Everyone knows it's tough to live here, but it does not have to continue this way. City council just has to act on what's actually important for our neighbors.

            Food should be a basic right, but wealth inequity makes getting enough to eat inaccessible for many. City council must lead the way to make sure none of our neighbors go hungry, especially when the federal government works to eliminate food subsidies.

        I’m Dan Ferrell, and I’m running for Asheville City Council to truly make Asheville a safe town for all of us. We live in a different world than we did a few years ago, and I want our town’s policies to reflect our community’s real needs.
      </h3>
      <h5>
        City council needs to work for our neighbors and our community, and not wait for disasters to happen to our community, but be proactive. Proactive with SNAP and WIC. Proactive with ICE and Border Patrol. Proactive with housing, food, water, shelter. The time has passed to go slow, and our leaders haven't acted with the same urgency our community has.
